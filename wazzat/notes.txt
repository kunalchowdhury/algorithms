1. The order book shouldnt contain FAK/FOK orders but it can contain limit orders
2. The aggressive queue shouldnt contain any unmatched orders neither FAK/FOK or Limit orders. All matching should be done from the book
3. The aggressive queue should be an indexed based array or list sorted by order timestamp . Also we should maintain a map of matched order ids in the book which are sent to ECN versus index in the array .
Since these are async calls to the ECN, once successful replies come back the corresponding entry in the array should be deleted.  
Whenever an element is added we should iterate through this array and scan for the opposite matching direction in the book at the given price.
